# Conversation-Starter
Welcome to Conversation-Starter2, a React Native app designed to help you start a conversation with ease. Using the power of Open AI API, this app provides users with conversation starters based on the situation they describe.

## How to Use
To use Conversation-Starter2, simply describe the situation in which you want to start a conversation. The app will analyze your input and generate a few ideas for conversation starting lines that you can use. For example:

User: I am trying to talk to a girl. She has a red dress and drinks wine. We are in a bar.
AI: "Excuse me, I couldn't help but notice the stunning red dress you're wearing. What type of wine are you drinking?‚Äù

While the app's suggestions may not always be perfect, we believe that it can still provide a helpful starting point for those who are struggling to start a conversation.

## Installation Instructions
